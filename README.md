# Web-ember-crud

This is one of my first tries of using EmberJS to build a simple CRUD application.
Its build with:
	*ember v2.5.0 
	*ember-cli for the project architecture
	*Mirage and fakerJs for fake data
	*bootstrap and plain CSS for modeling


If you want to try it just follow the next instrucions:

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running / Development

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
